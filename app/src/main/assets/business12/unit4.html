<h4>Concept of organization</h4>

<p class="a">

    The term organization is derived from the word organism. It is indicative of human body made of various sense organs and functions through their coordination.</br>
    Organization is an important management function which logically follows planning. It links ‘thinking about’ with ‘doing’. Goals set in paper are to be translated into action by grouping the resources. Organization involves determination of how best to group the resources. It is the mechanism of management to divide, control and coordinate the different activities.</br>
    In the management terminology, the term organization is sensed in two ways i.e. as a structure and as a process.</br>


</p>

<h4>Organization as a structure</h4>

<p class="a">

    Organization is the structure relationship by which an enterprise is bound together and the framework in which the individual effort is coordinated.</br>
    Several factors determine the organization structure. However, four major factors that play vital role are:</br>
    i.	Job design</br>
    ii.	Departmentation</br>
    iii.	span of control</br>
    iv.	Decentralization</br>



</p>


<h4>Organization as a process</h4>

<p class="a">

    Organization as process refers to one of the important functions of management i.e. organizing.</br>
    The process view of organization consists of dividing work among group and individuals and providing for the required coordination between and group activities.</br>
    In the dynamic sense, organization is a process of holding together a framework of positions which can be used as a management tool for the most effective pursuit of the goal of an enterprise.</br>
    As process organization involves:</br>
    i.	Identification of work</br>
    ii.	Group related activities</br>
    iii.	Selection of personnel</br>
    iv.	Establish formal reporting relationship</br>
    v.	Delegate authority</br>
    vi.	Evaluation and control

</p>

<h4>Principle of Organizing</h4>

<p class="a">

    Principles are the basic statement or fundamental truth that provides understanding and guidance to thinking and practice. Over the years, a body of principles has evolved in the field of management, some of which can be traced back to the earliest record of mankind. Four our study, the essential principles are classified in the following manner:</br>

    <b>i. Overall principles:</b></br>
    Principles essential for effective and logical functioning fall in this category. They are:</br>
    a)	Simplicity</br>
    b)	Flexibility</br>
    c)	Efficiency</br>
    d)	Unity of objectives</br>
        <b>ii. Structural principles:</b></br>
    Principles which have a bearing on the fundamental design and shape of the enterprise are such principles. Some important ones in this context are:</br>
    a)	Division of work</br>
    b)	Fundamental definition</br>
    c)	Optimum departmentation</br>
    d)	Unity of direction</br>
    e)	Homogeneity</br>
    f)	span of control</br>
            <b>iii. Operational principles:</b></br>
    Principles which have a bearing on the functioning of the organization belong to the category. Some important such principles are:</br>

    a)	Coordination</br>
    b)	Communication</br>
    c)	Management by exception</br>
    d)	Balance</br>

<h4>Function of Organizing</h4>

<p class="a">

    The discussion so far made about organizing bring to light that the functions of organizing involves:</br>
    <b>1. Differentiation</b></br>
    It is necessary because one person cannot handle all the activities, not to talk of efficiency. Differentiation thus consists of</br>
    I.	Job design, wherein the contents of work is defined, task required to be performed for achieving goal identified and</br>
    II.	Departmention, wherein activities are grouped into departments and</br>
    III.	Designing structure wherein span of control, authority-responsibility relationship, delegation of authority established for flow of work.</br>
    <b>2. Integration</b></br>
    The function of integration consists of coordination. Mechanisms are established to achieve unity of efforts. All differentiated activities are coordinated through the mechanisms set. Use of appropriate communication channels is made for coordination. So to say, it is the synchronization and unification of the activities of group of people to achieve the common objective.

</p>

<h4>Importance of Organizing as a management function</h4>

<p class="a">

    Importance of organizing can be discussed by dividing into two categories:</br>
    <b>a) Basic importance:</b></br>
    The role of organization in an enterprise can be well compared with a vehicle. Just as a vehicle enables a person to reach his destination, similarly, by the vehicle of the organization, the group of person in enterprise objectives.</br>
    <b>b)  Other importance:</b></br>
    Apart from the basic importance, organization is important due to the following reason too.</br>
    I.	Facilitate specialization</br>
    II.	Defines authority responsibility relationships</br>
    III.	Facilitates growth and diversification</br>
    IV.	Coordination and communication</br>
    V.	Provides job satisfaction and increases productivity</br>
    VI.	Better industrial relations</br>
    VII.	Optimum use of technological improvements</br>


</p>


<h4>Organizing process</h4>

</p>

<h4>Functional organization</h4>
<p class="a">
    The focus of this type of organization is specialization. It was developed by F.W. Taylor in 1900s as an attempt to overcome the difficulties of the line type. Taylor felt that a foreman alone cannot perform the total activities of a department efficiently. He cannot be expected to have all qualities essential for the desired performance. As such he suggested specialist foreman instead of only foreman. It is perhaps the most logical and basic form.</br>
    Responsibility of each position are:</br>
    At the planning level:</br>
    1.	Order of work clerk</br>
    2.	Instruction card clerk</br>
    3.	Time and cost clerk</br>
    4.	Disciplinarian</br></br>

    At the shop level:</br>
    1.	Gang boss</br>
    2.	speed boss</br>
    3.	repair boss</br>
    4.	Inspector</br>
</p>


<h4>Characteristics of functional organization</h4>
<p class="a">
    1.	Based on specialization, different functions are divided among different departments.</br>
    2.	Each function is the responsibility of a specialist.</br>
    3.	Subordinates are controlled by many specialists.</br>
    4.	Managers have both line and functional authority.</br>
    5.	Separation of planning from actual working.
</p>


<h4>Advantages of functional organization</h4>
<p class="a">
    1.	Benefit of specialization</br>
    2.	Reduction in work load</br>
    3.	Separation of physical and mental work</br>
    4.	Avoid dictatorial approach</br>
    5.	Facilitates growth and expansion</br>
    6.	Suitable

</p>

<p class="a">
    1.	Higher cost</br>
    2.	Delayed decisions</br>
    3.	Violation of unity of command</br>
    4.	Problem in fixing responsibility</br>
    5.	Replacement problem


</p>

<h4>Line and Sta0ff Organization</h4>
<p class="a">
    It is a combination of line and fundamental type. It is an improvement over the preceding two types designed to secure the merits of both. it attempts to maintain balance between too much concentration on control under line type and too much functions under functional. to meet the needs of growth and as a logical improvement on Taylor’s functional type, the total activity of the enterprise is separated into executive and advisory functions.</br>
    Characteristics of line and staff organization</br>
    I.	Clear demarcation of thinking and doing.</br>
    II.	Combination of unity of command and specialization.</br>
    III.	It has two types of officers-line and staff.</br>
    IV.	Only the line officers have authority to command.</br>
