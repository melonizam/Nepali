<h4>Taylor Scientific Management </h4>

<p class="a">
    Frederick Winslow Taylor is regarded as the father of scientific management. He published his work “Principle of scientific Management” in 1911 A.D. His work was revolving around following three things:</br>
    1.	the loss suffered by any nation is the result of the citizens individual act;</br>
    2.	Efficiency lies in scientific management rather on in any extraordinary men; and</br>
    3.	Best management is the basis of three science that is clearly defined laws, principles and rules.</br>
    Scientific management is the art of knowing exactly what is to be done and how it is to be done in the best and cheapest way.</br>
    In the word of F.W. Taylor, “Scientific management means knowing exactly what you want men to do and seeing that they do in the best and cheapest way.”</br>
    Scientific management is an attitude of applying scientific knowledge and techniques at work place to improve the management and philosophy of discarding the conventional rule of thumb. Finally, scientific management is concerned with:</br>
    •	Higher efficiency through the application of scientific knowledge and techniques.</br>
    •	Finding out “one best way” to perform a job/task.</br>
    •	Scientific selection of the employees and train them in the so call best way and make them to perform more.

<h4>Principle of Scientific Management</h4>

<p class="a">
    The following are the principle of scientific management:</br>
    <b>a) Replacement of the rule of thumb with science</b></br>
    It is depends on the scientific observations and experimentations. Hence, scientific management is based on finding out the best method of getting things done which allows the optimal utilization of resources.</br>
    <b>b) Harmony in group activity</b></br>
    Scientific management helps harmony in group activity. Harmony means unity of action and discord means differences.</br>
    <b>c) Maximum output</b></br>
    Scientific management refers to the process of knowing exactly what is to be done and how it is to be done in the best and cheapest way.</br>
    <b>d) Development of employee</b></br>
    To apply the scientific knowledge and techniques, organization need to go for scientific selection, development and utilization of human resources. Success of an organization based upon the competent employee.</br>
    <b>e) Mental revolution of both management and workers</b></br>
    Taylor’s principle of scientific management emphasizes that there must be mental revolution on part of both management and workers. It is realized that no plan of management will succeed unless there is a feeling that they have to work hard.</br>
</p>


<h4>Limitation of Scientific Management</h4>

<p class="a">
    The following are the major limitation of scientific management:
    <b> 1. Focus of mechanistic approach</b></br>
    It provides more emphasis on technical aspects of the work. Employee gets remuneration on the basis of their production units not on the basis of time spent.</br>
        <b>2. Ignores human relation approach</b></br>
    Employee gets remuneration on the basis of their efficiency. It does not mention about informal relation between workers on the job in order to meet their social need.</br>
            <b> 3. Employees feel monotony</b></br>
    Employees are not motivated involving in innovative and creative work on the basis of their efficiency. Workers have no life outside their work.</br>
                <b>4. More work load</b></br>
    IT focused only on to forced to speed up the process beyond their capacity to maximum productivity. This short of practice creates physical as well as mental problems among the employees.</br>
                    <b>5. Lack of initiation</b></br>
    Foemen issued detailed set of instructions in respect of the job to be performed and the method of performing it. Therefore, workers cannot show their creativity.
