<h4>Concept of planning</h4>
<p class="a">
    “Well begun is half done” goes the saying. Well beginning starts from good planning. Starting of any work start with a plan.</br>
    To plan is to decide in advance what, where, when and how to do the desired things by whom. It is a process of thinking before doing by avoiding to work on bunch basis.</br>
    Planning is the primary management function. All other management function depends on the type of planning done. It is fundamentally and intellectual exercise, a mental gymnastics and paper pencil work. It involves:</br>
    •	looking ahead</br>
    •	determination of objective</br>
    •	developing alternative course of action for achievement of objective</br>
    •	Selecting the best course of action.</br>
    Thus planning is the process of deciding the destination along with the methods and actions. It helps to foresee the hazards and pitfalls well in time, so one is equipped to face them they arrive.</br>
    According to Mary Cushing Niles, “Planning is the conscious process of selecting and developing the best course of action to accomplish an objective.”

<h4>Type of planning</h4>
<p class="a">
    An organization may have different types of plans which are as follows:-
    <b>a)	Operational, tactical and strategic planning:</b></br>
    Operational plans are short ranged plans usually done at lower levels extending upto 1 year. They are usually made in a specific and detailed manner.</br>
    Tactical also known as coordinative or intermediate plans are less detailed than operational plans</br>
    Also known by the name of long range planning, determination of ways to acehive organization is strategic planning</br>
        <b>b)	Proactive and reactive planning:</b></br>
    Proactive planning fills holes created by unforeseen events. Through it, future can be commended rather than being commanded. Proactive planning is a philosophy, a way of thinking about managing the future.</br>
    Reactive planning is on the other hand doesn’t give consideration to what we desire the future to be like and as a result, the future of the organization is left to the vagaries of societal process.</br>
            <b>c)	Formal and informal planning:</b></br>
    Formal planning is a written documented plan developed through an identifiable process. It is a hard mental work which forces managers to observe the rules of ‘Look before you leap’ strictly. It is rational and systematic.</br>
    Informal plans are the result of working by managers without recording their thought but, simply keeping in their minds. There is no provision for unanticipated situations in informal planning.</br>
                <b>d)	Functional and corporate planning:</b></br>
    Functional planning is tunnel vision in nature. If different department prepare their own separate plans without unified focus, coordination problems may arise.</br>
    Corporate planning is integrative in nature which has both macro and minor aspects. It is the synthesis of various functional plans.</br>

    <b>b) Other limitations:</b></br>
    I.	Costly and time consuming</br>
