Similarly, individual as managers take countless decisions in organizations. So to say, management is decision making. Management guru peter F.Drucker says, whatever a manager does he does through making decisions. It is equally important in performing all management functions.</br>
    According to George R.Terry “Selection based on some criteria from two or more possible alternatives.”</br>
    In the light of fact presented above and definitions quoted, it may be concluded that decision-making is the most essential management function for solving problems that may arise in various functional areas by developing different alternatives and selecting the best.</br>
</p>


<h4>Features of decision-making</h4>
<p class="a">
    <b>a) Goal oriented process:</b></br>
    Decision is usually made relating to achievement of goals. the intention behind making every decision is to move towards the desired state of affairs within the time limit set.</br>
    b) Selective process:</b></br>
    It involves the activity of search and choice. The decision maker search means to solve the problem and arrives with different alternative solutions. Choice leads to decision.</br>

    c) Dynamic process:</b></br>
    It is concerned with identifying worthwhile things to do. While making decisions, it is essential to consider the situation, time of the organization.</br>
    d) Continuous process:</b></br>
    It starts before as enterprise is established and continues till its existence. It is a never ending process during the life time of the organization.</br>

    Decision-making implies freedom to the decision maker regarding the final choice.</br>
    g) Positive or negative:</b></br>
    Decision made may be positive or negative impact. The decision-maker should explore different possible alternatives, analyze and evaluate them and attempt to come out with decision which will have positive impact.

<h4>Importance of Decision-making</h4>
<p class="a">
    Decision-making is an indispensable component of management process. In fact, the end product of a manager’s work is decision. He has to decide the objectives and form policies to adopt for achieving them. Its importance is indicated in the following points:</br>
    <b>a) Indispensable job:</b></br>
    It is decision-making which determines all management function.</br>
    <b>b) Pervasive function:</b></br>
    Each level of management performs this activity. Policy level decisions are taken by top management, tactical decisions by middle level and operating decisions by lower level management.</br>
    <b>c) Evaluation of managerial action:</b></br>
    Decision-making is the important activity to evaluate the performance of mangers. Managers making quality decisions can be best evaluated and vice versa.</br>
    <b>d) Adoption to changing environment:</b></br>
    Decision making should be carried on with the consideration to the requirement of situation. It is essential to successfully operate the organization.</br>
    <b>e) Selection of best alternative:</b></br>
    Problem can be solved in different ways, but which suits the best needs decision. Hence, the importance of decision-making.</br>

<h4>Steps in Decision-making Process</h4>
<p class="a">
    Decision made on hunch basis without following a systematic and rational sequence may prove wrong. Knowledge alone, no matter how complete, may hardly produce creative ideas. Although there is no single sure path, the model presented below serves as a guideline for decision-making. It consist of different phases, much the same as that of planning. Decision thus made have a greater probability of solving the problem appropriately.</br>
    <b>1. Awareness of problem:</b></br>
    Recognizing problem is the first step in the process of decision-making. Problem generally arises because of disparity between the present and expected situation. At this stage, questions should be defined rightly rather than finding answers to them.</br>
    <b>2. Diagnose and state the problem:</b></br>
    For stating true problems, questions like what to do we want to accomplish? what is the problems? which problem needs solution urgently? which may be postponed for time-being? what is the real cause of the problem? Should be locked into carefully. It should  not be forgotten that a problem well defined is half-solved.</br>
    <b>3. Develop alternatives:</b></br>
    Ability to develop alternatives is as important as making a right decision among alternatives. Past experience and hunches should not be the only basis for making decisions. Managers should be prepared to say “May be there is a better way let’s try it.” Such a flexible mental framework would help in developing better alternatives.</br>
    <b>4. Evaluation of alternatives:</b></br>
    This step involves outlining the consequences, cost involved, advantages and disadvantages of each alternative. Each alternative has to be weighed with respect to how it will ultimately meet external and internal conditions. The primary objective of evaluation is not to find out one magic solution. Comparisons are usually made on the basis of values assigned to each alternative.</br>
    <b>5. Selection of best alternative:</b></br>
    For consider few factors before selection like:</br>
    i.	Assumption of risk and solution to it.</br>
    ii.	Greater output for least inputs.</br>
    iii.	Effective and efficient utilization of available physical, financial and human resources.</br>
    iv.	In urgent situations, alternative that dramatizes the decision may be suitable, when consistent effort is needed, slow start that gathers momentum may be preferred.</br>

    <b>6. Implementation and follow up:</b></br>
    This is where decision is put into action. However best the decision may look theoretically, actual result can be observed only after implementation. Only good decision is not enough to produce the desired result unless it is effectively implemented. The efficiency also is measured not only by the decision made but by their effective implementation.

<h4>Types of Managerial Decisions</h4>
<p class="a">
    Decisions are of different types. They may be broadly classified as:
    <b>1. Depending on the issues involved:</b></br>
    a)	major or minor decision:-</br>
    Major decisions are taken by top level managers for major issues. Minor decisions are taken by lower level managers.</br>
    b)	Basic or routine decision:-</br>
    Basic decisions are strategic decisions which affect the future of an organization. On the other hand, routine decisions deal with day to day operations and are repetitive in nature.</br>
    c)	personal/organizational:-</br>
    Personal decisions also known as individual informal decisions are decisions concerning entirely personal matters taken purely based on one’s self interest, desire and necessary.</br>
    <b>2. Depending on procedures adopted:</b></br>
    a)	Programmed:-</br>
    Programmed decisions are similar to the routine decisions. Rules and policies are established well in advance to solve recurring problems quickly. They are relatively easy for managers to make.</br>
    b)	Non-programmed:-</br>
    Un-programmed decisions are unstructured which deal with unusual problems. Such decisions require use of judgment, creativity and experience on the part of mangaer.</br>
