<h3 align="center"><u>DESCRIBING THINGS IN YOUR ROOM</u></h3>
<p class="a">

 A man lives in a society. He needs many things in his life. Food, cloth and house are his basic needs. A house protects him from heat, coldness and rain. Some people live in their own rooms and other people live in common rooms. But, I live in my own room.<br><br>

My room is on the second floor. It is quite big too. It is under the roof of the house. It is painted with light green colour. There are two big windows on both sides. So, my room is very bright and sunny. I have painted the windows with white colour. There is a double bed at the right corner of the room. There is a book rack by the bed. There is a table next to the book rack. A big cassette player and some textbooks are on the table. There are three chairs around it. A green carpet is on the floor. All my clothes are on the hanger which is on the door. I have used another corner of the room as a kitchen. It is at the back side of the bed.  There are many pots inside the kitchen rack. A gas stove is on it. There are some pictures of famous persons, beautiful posters and a calendar on the wall. My room is in the open area. So, a beautiful scene of nature can be seen from my room.<br><br>

My hobbies have become a part of my life. Life, without it, would be dull and monotonous. It would be devoid of all charms. Hobby gives variety to life and interest in work. Gardening is not my business; it is not the profession of my life. Yet it is not less importunities for the study of plant life. It also gives physical exercise. I not only get the pleasure from my hobby gardening but also money sometimes by selling the flowers, fruits and vegetables.<br><br>

But, it has some problems. Sometimes, when the rain falls, water leaks from the roof. The glass of one window is broken. There is no glass in another window. I have covered it with plastic.  There is not a fan on the ceiling. It is near the cinema hall. So, it disturbs me too much.However, my room is very comfortable. It is very beautiful. I like my room very much.
