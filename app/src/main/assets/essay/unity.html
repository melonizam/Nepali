<h3 align="center"><u>NATIONAL UNITY</u></h3>
<p class="a">

National unity means one nation as a whole formed in a one complete nation. Many people of different castes live in the same nation. They speak different languages. They have different modes of living and different religions. There are Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Sikhs etc. though we have unity.<br><br>

We can give several examples of the power of unity. Power lies in unity, not in diversity. A drop of water is not too strong enough to wash anything away the whole villages. A thin thread is very weak. Even a child can break it but when a number of threads are woven into a thick rope that an elephant can't break so what made a feeble thread so strong. So unit is strength or power.<br><br>

Unity brings peace and development. If we have good relationship with others our enemies can't take advantage. It always drives peace. If there is peace the development works can run smoothly throughout the country. Now a day we have a glance of peace but the development works hasn't been run as usual. Because of lack of political instability and wrong ideology people are being divided into groups in the name of region, castes and religions. The poverty is being increased day by day.<br><br>
The government of Nepal has always urged the people to realize the value of national unity. The villagers have to be given the education about national unity. There should be punishment for criminal works otherwise a person can be hanged and died miserably.
