<h3 align="center"><u>Television</u></h3>
<p class="a">The scientists of the world are inventing many kinds of modern technologies, which have made our lives quite easier. Among many such modern inventions, a television is the most important invention of modern science.<br><br>

Television is becoming popular day by day. A black and white television is much cheaper than a colour television. Although, television gives a lot of information, it may be harmful especially for children. It makes the environment of a house very bad. One forgets to do one's daily works. It makes the people very passive. Sometimes, television shows obscene scenes and broadcasts false news that affects onlookers negatively.<br><br>

There are so many advantages of television. One can watch and listen to news, informative and entertaining programmers on a television. One can get practically lots of information and entertainments from television. Television is a friend of loneliness. One can know the incidents happened all over the world just by sitting in one's own single room.<br><br>

One should not watch television more than necessary. One should watch television, only after completing one's duties and works. In conclusion, television is a curse as well as a boon. If we misuse it, it will be a curse. If we use it properly, it will be a boon.
