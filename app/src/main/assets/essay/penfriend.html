<h3 align="center"><u>PEN FRIEND</u></h3>
<p class="a"> I have got a pen-friend. His name is John Smith. He lives in America. He is 16 years old. He is very healthy and he weighs 55 kg. His colour of skin is brown. He has got black eyes, which are quite big. He keeps moustache, but he has no  beard. He has a white set of  teeth. He has got attractive smile and charming voice. When he laughs, dimples fall on the both sides of his cheeks. Similarly, he has got golden colour of hair with center parting. Unfortunately, his face is full of marks of acnes. But he is helpful, kind and friendly. He studies very hard in a university. He has a good sense of humour too. Everybody loves him very much and I also like him very much.
