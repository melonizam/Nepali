<h3 align="center"><u>THE LOVING MOTHER - A Story From the Island of Hokkaido,Japan</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    Mr Shoji Sakota was a pharmacist in the city of Sappora on Hokkaido Island in northern Japan. He
    used to have his own drug store in the same building, where he used to live. He used to live
    alone in the rear part of the building because his wife had died several years earlier. One
    stormy winter night in 1964, he was working in his room at about mid night. As it was the end of
    the fiscal / financial year, he was very busy with the profit, loss and the accounts of the
    whole year. At that time, there was a knock at his door. At first, he avoided it. But the
    knocking persisted or repeated. At last, he opened the door thinking that somebody might have
    come for some very important medicine. It was a woman who wanted an ame (Japanese candy used for
    pacifying young children) on a stick for her baby. Mr Sakota was quite surprised at it because
    the lady was buying sweet at that time of night. He was very much moved or surprised by the
    appearance of the lady. She was so strange that her hair was disheveled / messy / uncombed /
    untidy and her eyes were quite strange.<br><br>

    In short, she looked a lady from another world. The lady went from there but somehow or other Mr
    Sakota could not forget her appearance and at last he left working and went to the bed. On the
    next night, the same woman came and both the times she asked for an ame. Mr Sakota was all the
    more worried. He had a friend with whom he shared his worries. The friend was a photographer.
    So, they planned to snap the lady if she came the next time or next night.<br><br>

    The next night also, the lady came at the same time and with the same demand. The photographer
    friend was hiding in the shop and he snapped the lady from different angles. But, when the
    photographs came, they were quite surprised to find that all articles were present in the
    photograph but not the lady. Then the two friends decided to follow her the next time if she
    came.<br><br>

    The next night also, the lady arrived at the same time and asked for an ame. When she left the
    shop, the two friends followed her quietly. Finally, they reached to a room in an old building.
    In the room, they found a baby sucking or licking an ame and the woman appeared to be sleeping
    there in the bed. When they tried to wake up the lady, they realized that she was dead and they
    felt that she had been dead for several days.<br><br>

    The conclusion is that after her death the lady's soul was worried about the child. She not only
    wanted to arrange for food for her child but she also wanted someone to come and know that she
    had been dead and her child was in a helpless situation. She had selected Mr Sakota for this.
