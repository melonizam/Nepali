<h3 align="center"><u>THE LOST DOLL - A Story from Colombia, South America</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    Carmen was the only child of Roberto and Rosa Soto. She was beautiful, bright and loving child.
    However she was sick from the day of her birth. When she was four, she fell sick seriously and
    died. A few days after the funeral ceremony, Rosa gave away Carmen's playthings and clothes to a
    priest of another village so that she couldn't see them time and again. She thought that she
    wouldn't have another child as she was told at the time of Carmen's birth. When Roberto knew
    about it, he became very unhappy because he was hopeful that they would have another child. He
    asked about her the little dolly which Carmen always carried with her. Rosa said that she didn't
    give it away. Then they searched everywhere in the house as well asked the villagers too but
    they couldn't find it.<br><br>

    However they soon forgot about the lost doll because Rosa became pregnant. On the first
    anniversary of the death of Carmen, Rosa gave birth to another child. Roberto and Rosa became
    very happy. She was named Evangelina, which meant "good news". When Evangelina grew she looked
    very much similar to her sister Carmen. But she was healthy girl. When she was about four, she
    told her mother that she had been sick a long time ago. She also told her aunt that she had a
    little, beautiful doll with blue eyes and red dress. She had buried it under a tree in the yard.
    She requested her mother to dig up the doll. When Rosa dug up the ground, she found the lost
    doll. She looked surprised, shocked and sick because it was difficult for her to believe.
    Evangelina also said that when she was sick, the nice man came and helped her to bury that doll
    under the tree.<br><br>

    The story accounts the supernatural significance regarding its particular focus on the concept
    of reincarnation. When Evangelina was born and grown up, she looked very much similar to that of
    Carmen's actions, characters, behaviors and other many things were very much similar. The priest
    said that God healed Carmen and sent her back in the form of healthy Evangelina. Though Rosa did
    not believe that her newly born child as the reincarnation of Carmen but she could not reject
    the mysterious fact towards the end of the story. When Evangelina reported everything about past
    and about her doll, Rosa could say nothing anymore.</p><br>
