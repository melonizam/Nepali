<h3 align="center"><u>FEAR - The Story from Puebla, Mexico</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    Though the story Fear is from the unit of the supernatural stories, it is not a supernatural
    story. In fact, it is a psychological story. It's a thriller / suspenseful story based on human
    fear of a nervous man. This story also shows how a man behaves in a state of panic and
    nervousness.<br><br>

    The main character of the story is Armando Gonzalez. He was a man who had to look after a big
    family of nine members. However, he had a dream. It was a common dream to have a house of his
    own. With this aim, he had saved 50,000 pesos since the last many years (20 years).<br><br>

    On that very day, he went to the bank to withdraw 50,000 pesos because he had seen a house
    within that limit. The deal was finalized and he had to do the payment. He was very careful from
    the beginning. The bank was slightly crowded that day and he did not like it. In his turn, the
    bank accountant started to count the money loudly which Armando did not like. He feared other
    people would know that he was carrying a heavy amount and anybody could loot him.<br><br>

    He caught a bus to go home. There he met a man whom he had already seen in the bank. Not only
    that he had dashed against him and he had given a double look at Armando Gonzalez. Here, he
    found the same man getting on the same bus. Now, there was no doubt to Armando that man intended
    to rob him. Everybody in the bus was looking at him only because he was putting his hat
    backwards. But, what Armando thought was that they were looking at him because they had the
    knowledge that he was carrying 50,000 pesos. He started to see a thief on each face. This
    increased his nervousness all the more.<br><br>

    After some time, he found that the man was talking to three other boys. He thought that they
    were making secret plans to loot him. This heightened his nervousness and he made a plan to get
    off the bus at next stop and to take another bus from there and he did accordingly.<br><br>

    Suddenly, he also saw that the same three boys had got off there. Now, it was sure to Armando
    that it was a part of the robbery. Now, he was panic stricken. He started to run shouting for
    help. The three boys also started to run after him only with the intention to help him. But,
    there was no limit to Armando's fear and he was running as fast as he could. Suddenly, his feet
    got entangled with some thing and he fell down. Before he got up, the three boys came up to him.
    Armando started to implore / beg / plead them not to rob him. They were also surprised at it and
    they said that they were not intending to loot him. Rather they were students and they were
    there for a football tournament and that they were running after him because he was shouting for
    help.<br><br>

    Now, his fear is gone and he got up and put his cap on and this time he put it rightly. At this
    time, all the four walked up slowly back to the street.</p><br>
