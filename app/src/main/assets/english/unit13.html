<h3 align="center"><u>THE CHILDREN WHO WAIT - Marsha Traugot</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    Marsha Traugot's essay "The children Who Wait" discusses the scene of adoption in American
    context. Marsha Traugot begins her essay with the picture of Tammy, which has been published in
    a magazine with the hope that someone would be ready to adopt her. She is five and half years
    old with the face of Mona Lisa. The writer describes her unadaptable child had she been born
    before 1960. During that period only white healthy children were considered adaptable.
    Physically deformed children's were referred as damaged goods. No one was ready to adopt such
    children. The children who were black, mixed racial group, handicapped and over five years were
    not adopted by families. This view, however, started disappearing after the sixties.<br><br>

    People's attitude towards them gradually became positive. The change in thoughts was brought by
    various factors. Traugot mentions black civil right movement, legalization of abortion, change
    in attitude of the people, and change in government's policy as responsible factors. Black civil
    rights movement brought sympathetic attitude towards black people. White people started
    regarding them as humans and treated accordingly. Another responsible factor was women's
    movement. Because of women's movement they got right to decide on the matter of childbirth in
    addition to other right. The lady who had to do abortion to maintain her status could live with
    dignity with her child. It has the impact in reduction of unwanted children. The third factor
    responsible for change in attitude was government's policy towards adoption. The government used
    to emphasize on foster care before the seventies. As they became aware about the drawbacks of
    foster care, they made changes in their policy. Rater than emphasizing on foster care, they
    tried to find permanent home for the homeless children. Another factor responsible is the role
    played by social activists. Their campaign brought changes not only in attitude of the people
    but also in their behavior. Prior to the 1960, the social activists considered white, two
    parent, and middle or upper class childless family as an ideal adoptive family. But now the
    situation has changed. The social workers give children for adoption to even single or two
    parents, black or biracial, upper class or working class, childless or families with older
    siblings. The catch phrase of the social worker is 'matching'. Activists try to get proper
    family for destitute child. Unlike previous activists, they can't get two-parent family. Instead
    of searching for two-parent family, they need to evaluate the characteristic of a child and
    match it with the proper family. Now adoption agencies collect the lists of parents who want to
    adopt child. They match qualities of children with the need of parents, let both of them meet
    and interact. They even hold meetings and discuss about the children and the types of families
    where they can put them. Now adoption agencies collect the lists of parents who want to adopt
    child. They match qualities of children with the need of parents, let both of them meet and
    interact. If this system does not work, they publish the profile of homeless children in
    television or newspaper to look for adoptive parents.</p><br>
