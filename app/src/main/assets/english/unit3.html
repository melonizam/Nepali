<h3 align="center"><u>THE LAMENTATION OF THE OLD PENSIONER - W.B. Yeast</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    "The Lamentation of the Old Pensioner" written by W.B. Yeats, presents the speaker's
    reminiscences of his young life which become more painful when he contrasts his time of youth
    with his present old age. He laments on the passing of his joyful youth.<br><br>

    In the past, the speaker was young and he had a good job. So his friends and lovers followed
    him. He was happy to talk about love and politics. His past life only gives him agony because
    Time has turned him into ugly, weak and useless old man. Neither his friends nor any beauties
    follow him. He is envious to see other young people who challenge any conspiracy and evils. This
    old man, who is forced away from politics and love, is still tormented by the passions of his
    youth for women and conversation. He thinks that his greater enemy is Time because it made him
    old and stole his physical beauty, power and beautiful lovers. Time stole his youthful vitality,
    energy and sexual power. He compares his old stage with the broken tree. Time robbed all his
    happiness from him because it transfigured him into an ugly, powerless, passionless, deformed
    and lonely old man. So, he shows his anger against Time and spits on the face of it.
