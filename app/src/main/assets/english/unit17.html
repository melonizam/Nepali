<h3 align="center"><u>HANSEL AND GRETEL - Jacob and Wilhelm</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    Once there was a famine in a country, which compelled the step mother to think of leaving the
    children to the forest. The father yielded to the wish of wife, as she was pigheaded. In the
    morning, the step mother asked them to get ready to go to the forest. Hansel had collected
    pebbles as he had heard the conversation of parents the earlier night. As they left their home,
    the boy dropped pebbles on the way. After walking for some duration, they reached to a spot
    where the step mother asked the children to wait till they return back. But it was only a trick
    to leave the children in the forest.<br><br>

    At midnight, when they got up, the boy thought of returning to house. He could return
    successfully with the assistance of pebbles he had dropped. At home they were welcomed by the
    father though the mother was indifferent. There was another famine in the country, which forced
    the mother to bring the previous idea back again. The father accepted despite his unwillingness.
    The boy, unlike previous time, was unable to collect pebbles as the mother had locked the door
    from outside. Early in the morning, the children were woken up and given bread. The boy dropped
    the bread on the way making it crumbs. Unlike before, the parents took them deep into the
    forest. The children were left there. They wished that their parents would come which didn't
    happen as they had thought. The children couldn't return back to their house as the breads
    crumbs had been eaten by birds. They, at last reached to a house made of bread and cakes. As
    they nibbled from the house, a voice sweetly spoke them to continue. It was a witch, who used to
    eat children whoever came handy. The witch, on the next day imprisoned the brother and compelled
    the sister to do laborious deeds. Everyday the witch went there and checked how fat he had
    become.<br><br>

    The boy could deceive her with the help of a bone. As she realized that the lad would never
    become sedentary, she decided to end the consequence. Early in the morning, she ordered Gretel
    to fetch water. She had prepared oven to end the brother and sister. As Gretel arrived there,
    she asked her to be in. Gretel showed ignorance to the way of entering and asked her to
    demonstrate. No sooner had the witch tried to enter her head, she pushed her into oven and
    closed it. She then released her brother. They went inside the house and collected treasures. On
    the way back home, they arrived by a river, which was full of water. The boy asked a duck to
    help him across the river. As they reached their house after long walk, they saw their father,
    who welcomed them happily. Their step mother had already died.</p><br>

<h4>Important Questions :</h4>

<p class="b">

    1. Psychological analysis of Hansel and Gretel.<br><br>

    Ans. The writer in his adapted story Hansel and Gretel presents the psychological analysis of
    the story. In this story, he expresses a unique truth of life that poverty and deprivation make
    human beings selfish and less sensitive to others sufferings. The writer tells us that when the
    children grow up, they must learn to live separately from their parents. Hansel and Gretel have
    left in the forest in order to give them a chance to learn to live independently. However, they
    have come back as they have not been able enough to live apart from their parents. The children
    have again been left in the forest for the second time and they've tried to solve the problem by
    concentrating on fool only. As they've acted like hungry animals rather than human beings, they
    have been the captive of witch. The house and the old witch being the source of food are
    symbolized as mother. This story gives us message that greed leads to destruction. Hansel and
    Gretel manages to get rid of the witch when they start thinking and behaving like human beings.
    The white duck that helps Hansel and Gretel get home carrying across the water stretch is the
    symbol of new beginning. The duck can carry only one child at one time shows that children must
    learn to live independently without any support from their brothers and sisters. The bird which
    led them to the gingerbread house is a symbol of peace. When Hansel and Gretel return home, they
    have grown up and start helping their father. The help they render is symbolized by the jewels.
    The family is considered rich and happy not because of the wealth but because Hansel and Gretel
    have learnt to think and act like matured people.<br><br>


    2. Political analysis of Hansel and Gretel.<br><br>
    Ans. This story Hansel and Gretel written by Jack Zipes from political point of view tells us
    about the struggle between the poor and rich group of people. The woodcutter and his family
    represent the poor class people who are forced to commit deeds because of their poverty. The
    witch represents the aristocratic class of people and also symbolizes as the entire feudal
    system. She is also symbolized as the greed brutality of the aristocracy which is responsible
    for the difficult condition of the poorer class of people. The killing of the witch is
    symbolical realization of the hatred felt by the poor people because of the oppression and
    exploitation on them by the aristocratic people. The writer depicts the class conflict and
    exposes the prejudice and injustice of feudal ideology. The writer emphasizes that the poor
    people must be optimistic and should react appropriately against the oppressors for the
    transition of the situation in their favor.</p>
