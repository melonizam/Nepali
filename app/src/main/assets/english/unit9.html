<h3 align="center"><u>THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE GHOST SHIP - Garica Marquez</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    The boy, who is also main character of the story used to go to sea where he had seen a
    mysterious ship in his childhood. The ship used to appear when there was darkness and vice
    versa. The ship was bigger than the village and taller than the steeple of the church. But he
    could not see the ship in the later years. However the boy didn't stop going to sea. He had
    determined to show the existence of ship to the villager after he was beaten on charge of being
    a liar. After many years he saw the same ship by the harbor. He could not believe his
    eyes.<br><br>

    So until next March he waited to see the same ship. No sooner had he seen the ship than he went
    home to tell about it to his mother. His mother got angry with him; she advised him to get
    involved in romance with some lady instead of going to sea. The boy's mother however agreed to
    go there next march. But unluckily, his mother expired while she was sitting on a chair and
    thinking about her dead husband. This event made the boy angrier. His determination grew bolder;
    he wanted to prove the existence of ship to the villager and went towards that location with a
    lantern. He didn't stop anywhere; he went straight towards his destination. As he reached near
    the place, he saw the ship again. The ship was moving without any sound. His presence there made
    the ship disappear. Nonetheless, it reappeared after some time. The boy lit the lantern and
    showed it towards the ship. As he showed the light, a miracle happened. The ship started
    following him. The boy guided the ship towards the village. At last he took the ship there. The
    ship blasted as it reached there. The villagers came there running and saw the destruction of
    ninety thousand champagne glasses. The boy watched the villagers' gaping their mouth at the
    ship.</p><br>
