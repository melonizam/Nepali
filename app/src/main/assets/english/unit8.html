<h3 align="center"><u>A STORY - Dylan Thomas</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    The boy, with his uncle, was sitting in their room when the boy's uncle's friends came there.
    Their coming had the aim of deciding date for outing. They said that they had collected fund and
    liquor for outing. Afterwards the uncle's friends returned back to their home. The next day they
    came with the list of names for uncle's acceptance. He read the whole list and accepted all the
    names. Then there was his wife with china dog.<br><br>

    She threatened him that she would go her mother's house if he did not cancel the program. In
    anger she asked him to choose either her or outing. The uncle said that he preferred outing. On
    Saturday morning the uncle's wife left house. She had written a note to her husband in which she
    had asked him to put off shoes before going to bed. At about eight the uncle's friend came to
    his house with a charabanc. They became ready to go for outing. As they drove off, the women of
    the village peeped out from windows and boys bid them good-bye. No sooner had they crossed the
    village then reached to a public house. The uncle asked the boy to look after the charra whereas
    they went inside. A little later a man came and asked for the way to pub. The boy took the man
    there. Inside the pub he saw his uncle and his friends drinking, breaking the glasses and
    talking nonsense. The boy did not remain there. He was afraid of the situation. Afterwards the
    uncle and his friends came out and got into the charra.<br><br>

    Then they reached to a river where they all got down and played with water. From that time
    onwards, they forget the idea of Porthcrawl. By the evening they reached to place called
    Hermit's nest. There they decided to rest and enjoy drinking. They drank so much rum that they
    could not control their sense. They later made decision to return back. On the way home, they
    rested in a field and sat in a circle. They continued drinking there too.</p><br>

<h4>Important Question :</h4>

<p class="b">
    1. The plan was to go to Porthcawl for the outing. Did they ever reach there? Why?<br><br>
    Ans. The plan of the narrator's uncle and his friends was to reach to Porthcawl for the outing.
    But they could not reach to their destination because of their habit of drinking. But it does
    not mean that it was the only one cause for it ; there are many.The first cause was their late
    departure. It was only at eight o'clock they started their outing. Another cause of it was the
    late arrival of one of their partners. Because everyone was worried about himself, they moved
    without counting all heads. But when they knew that one was missing, they could not continue
    their journey. They returned to receive him. The third and the greatest of the causes as already
    said is their nature of drinking a lot. When they reached the mountain sheep, they drank a lot.
    They did not think of their destination. It was only after the owner informed them of the
    closing time. They came out though it was already late to reach to Porthcawl. No one worried
    about even after they came out. They thought of playing with water when they reached to river.
    Hence, they could not reach.</p>
