<h3 align="center"><u>GOD'S GRANDEUR - Gerard Manley Hopkins</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    In his sonnet "God's Grandeur" the poet G.M Hopkins praises the magnificence and glory of God.
    He describes the majestic deeds of God. He claims that God is omnipresent and omnipotent. The
    good deeds on earth are also the results of these qualities of God. Though human beings
    continuously destroy nature, it is never spent.<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is full of the greatness of God. Due to His greatness, the world
    shines like 'a shook foil'. It gathers to greatness, as it is full of resources. Despite this
    fact, human beings act adversely. They don't follow the commands of God; rather they function to
    destroy the world. Earlier generations destroyed the earth and so is the case with the present
    generation. People are more interested in materialist gain and possessions than in celebrating
    the glory of a loving, merciful, heavenly Father. They act as if they are not rational
    creatures. As a result of their deed, the earth has become dry; it has the smell of human beings
    instead of its natural smell. Indeed the earth has reached to the verge of destruction.
    Nevertheless, the world is not completely destroyed. Because of the freshness that is inside
    things, nature keeps on regenerating. The sun sets in the evening only to reappear in the
    morning. These all happenings are the results of the god's protection. He protects the earth
    just like a bird broods over the eggs.<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the world is infused with the glory of God and Christ offered His body
    to be crucified, mankind does not live in awe of God, but imposes darkness on itself by running
    endlessly. Even so, despite humanity's shortcomings, God is most capable of perfect love and
    embraces the world anyway. The poet is of the opinion that human beings acts are always directed
    towards destruction: knowingly or unknowingly. But God loves all the creatures of the world, so
    he works for the benefit of the creatures without any hope of benefit or profit. The poet
    inspires people to grow faith in God.
