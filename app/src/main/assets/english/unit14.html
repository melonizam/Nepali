<h3 align="center"><u>A CHILD IS BORN - Germaine Greer</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    Childbirth management in the Eastern society varies from place to place. The mother is familiar
    about the way of giving birth to child in such society because they are used to in such customs.
    They don't feel so much physical and mental tension while giving birth. The approach in Eastern
    society is ritualistic. She is covered with taboos and prohibitions which reduces her
    psychological burden.<br><br>

    All the relatives including the husbands remain present during the process of giving birth. It
    decreases the pain of the mother. Their presence gives a sense of security to her. They create
    such an environment which make mother feel safe. Nevertheless, the chance of death of mother is
    high in Eastern society. In many of the Eastern societies, a pregnant woman goes to her mother's
    house. For example: the writer presents us an example from society of India. In Rajput society,
    the woman goes to mother's house prior to giving birth and after the birth to the child. She is
    taken care properly. The birth of the child is celebrated with singing and dancing. The pregnant
    woman is taken care not only by family members but also by the members of the community. It
    gives her a sense of security and she becomes less worried about giving birth. There is
    difference in child rearing also. In the Eastern society the mother gets respect after she gives
    birth. She is called by the name of her first child. The newly born child is taken care by all
    the relatives. The mother has to spend less time in taking care of child. So, the child-family
    relation is stronger than child-mother relation. Thus, the Eastern society is better than the
    Western society in the matter of childbirth and childcare. The Eastern society, however is not
    unaffected by the method of Western society.<br><br>

    Because of modernization, people in the Western societies are forced to use modern equipments.
    The modern equipments certainly have saved the lives of mother and child; nevertheless they are
    unable to reduce the anxiety of mother while giving birth. A pregnant woman in the West has to
    take care of herself with the guidance of nurses and doctors. The nurses and doctors do not give
    caressing hand to the pregnant woman. The health of mother and child is safer but mother is
    emotionally weaker. Child is born to fulfill the needs of parents only. The child grows up with
    its parents and dolls. So, child â€“ mother relation is stronger. The mother has to bear all the
    problems during child birth and child rearing.</p><br>

<h4>Important Question :</h4>

<p class="b">
    1. What differences does the writer show us between a traditional society and modern west in
    matters of pregnancy, childbirth and child raring?<br><br>
    Ans. In traditional societies, when a woman becomes pregnant, she has to observe certain
    prohibitions and carry out the set rites. All these taboos and prohibitions help her keeping
    herself mentally free and to lessen the pain and fear. The pregnant lady is helped by her
    husband and other members of family and community which enhances her sense of security. But in
    the modern west societies, the pregnant lady has to take care of herself. In such
    individualistic society, no other family member renders any support that helps the pregnant lady
    feel secure. She has to undertake all the preparations for newcomer by herself. In traditional
    societies, child birth irrespective of its sex is celebrated although there is a greater risk of
    the lives of the mother and the baby. The woman, after the birth of the child is fully accepted
    by the new family and she is allowed to visit her father's house. The women in such societies
    are started calling after the names of their children ignoring their original identity which the
    western people criticize calling it a wrong behavior. However, in the west, although modern and
    sophisticated hospitals are there, a child is born in an isolated hospital bed surrounded by
    modern medical equipments. There is no one to welcome the child and to support the lady
    emotionally to help lessen difficulties in western societies. In traditional society, the
    children are usually looked after collectively by the family members. The entire family is
    involved to bathe and to feed the children collectively. In the evening, children are told fairy
    tales by other members of the family. However, these practices aren't seen in modern western
    societies. The respective family mothers have to take care of their children by themselves as
    there is no help form other family members in the matter of child care.The writer argues that
    the traditional east is far better than the modern west in matters of pregnancy, childbirth and
    child raring although there is high risk of mothers and children mortality rate in these
    societies.</p>
