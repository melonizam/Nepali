<h4>1. <u>Find good location</u>
</h4>
<p class="a">

Studying in places that have less noise and people traffic will result in more effective study time and improve your ability to recall information that you went over during that time.Swapping study locations every once in a while has proved to help students retain information better. So instead of sitting for hours on sam place,get up once in a while and find another spot to finish your study session.
</p>

<h4>2. <u>Gather your materials</u></h4>
<p class="a">
Gather and organize all of the materials and resources necessary for you to ace your exams. Get together your class notes, old tests and assignments, class handouts, past exam papers and relevant textbooks.
</p>
<h4>3. <u>Make a study plan</u></h4>
<p class="a">
Making an effective and realistic study plan is a vital component of doing well in your finals. By planning out your study, you can ensure that you will have all the necessary materials covered by the time the exams roll around, thus minimizing stress and maximizing productivity.So Create a time chart of your current activities. Factor in classes, work, time spent with family and friends, etc. This will allow you to see how much free time you have available for study.

</p>
<h4>4. <u>Determine your study goals</u></h4>
<p class="a">
You shouldn't just write guidelines like "study math" your study plan needs to be specific.Break down your study material into specific topics and tasks and fill these into your study schedule.
 </p>
<h4>5. <u>Stick to your schedule</u></h4>
<p class="a">
A study schedule is no good if you don't stick to it. That's why it needs to be realistic. Factor in breaks and potential distraction when planning, so there will be no excuses when the time comes. If it helps, think of the study schedule like eating food daily. You have no option but to do it.
</p>
<h4>6. <u>Take breaks</u></h4>
<p class="a">
Before hitting your breaking point, take a break. After a while of non-stop studying, you begin to lose focus and the quality of your studying begins to falter. Give yourself a few minutes to stand up, stretch, go for a walk,just take some time to pause and take a deep breath so you improve your focus and productivity.
</p>
<h4>7. <u>Test yourself</u></h4>
<p class="a">
One of the best ways to prepare for a test is by, well, taking tests. Even though we might hate to admit it, taking practice tests will help you relearn the information you've already learned while enhancing your understanding of the subject matter you're studying.Ask others to ask u a questions which you have studied.
