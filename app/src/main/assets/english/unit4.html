<h3 align="center"><u>TWO LONG TERMS PROBLEMS - Moti Nissani</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    In the brief essay, Two Long Term Problems: Too Many People, Too Few Trees, Moti Nissani
    discusses two inter related problems they are, overpopulation and deforestation. With their
    impact showing several consequences of the twin problems, the writer makes us aware about our
    duties to solve them and to save the bio-sphere for our future generation.<br><br>

    Scientist from all over the world express their serious concern (worry) about present state of
    bio-sphere as human activities caused very serious damage on environment and on critical
    resources. With the introduction of modern medical facilities, nutrition and sanitation, the
    world's population started growing more than 80 million per year. In Nepal only, in less than 50
    years the population increases at the rate of 2.5% per year from 9 million to 25 million. If
    this alarming growth continuous unchecked, the population of Nepal will be 46 million by 2026
    A.D. which would be very difficult for Nepal to accommodate. In order to feed more people, more
    forest, lands are destroyed in a very large scale.<br><br>

    As a result, soil erosion, desertification, flood, landslide, tropical diseases, siltation of
    rivers and dams and mass migration are increasing. High growth of population has already
    polluted our food, air, water, rivers, soil, drains and farms. The chances of cancers and
    emphysema (lungs disease) and asthma are far higher now and we are suffering from pre-mature
    hearing loss. Lead and dioxide are causing serious effect on children's intelligence and health.
    The world has already faced frightening problems such as desertification, acid rain, loss of
    wild species of plants and animals, ozone layer depletion and green house effect because of
    human caused pollution.<br><br>

    However the situation could be improved by controlling population and pollution, many factors
    such as modernization, effective family planning measures equal economic, educational and legal
    opportunities to woman will help to control the rapid population growth. In order to set this
    world for our future generation, we must save forest by reducing population pressure on it
    through effective family planning measures and educating people. We may also save the forest by
    making effective and strict laws with a provision to impose high tax on wood product and
    provision of incentive for pressuring forest. There should be a provision in the law to punish
    severely for destroying forest. Massive reforestation, another effective step will benefit the
    world in conserving biodiversity, pristine wildness and to minimize desertification, flood and
    weather extremes. By controlling population and saving forest, we may solve this planet for our
    future generation utilizing our knowledge to convert our wisdom, courage and passion into
    practice to turn this world into a heaven.<br>
