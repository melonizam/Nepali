<h3 align="center"><u>GRANDMOTHER - Ray Young Bear</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    "Grandmother" written by American- Indian poet Ray Young Bear is a recollection of poet's
    unfathomable love for his grandmother. The poet draws the picture of his grandmother - all
    loving, all inspiring- through the use of images.<br><br>

    As a grandson, the poet's heart is very close to his grandmother. This poem presents the poets
    deep sense of intimacy and closeness to his grandmother even after her death. He can not forget
    her. Her images come into his mind as fresh as before. He could recognize her by all senses
    except taste. If the poet would see her from a long distance, he could easily recognize her. Her
    warm and damp hands with the smell of roots on his head would make him guess that those were her
    caressing hands. Even the voice coming out of her tombstone would flow inside him like a light
    coming from a sleeping fire at night. Her words would inspire him and enlighten his spirit.</p>
