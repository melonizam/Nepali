<h3 align="center"><u>FULL FATHOM FIVE THY FATHER LIES - William Shakespeare</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    Fathom Five Thy Father Lies" is taken from Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Here the spirit
    Ariel sings this song to Ferdinand, Prince of Naples, who mistakenly thinks that his father is
    drowned.<br><br>

    Ariel says that Ferdinand's father is dead and is lying thirty feet below in the sea bed. The
    Prince is very sad to miss his father in a sea-wind, so Ariel gives sympathy to him by saying
    that death is a meaningful change. He says that the bones of his father have turned into coral
    and eyes into pearls. Sea-nymphs respect him with death bell every hour. None of the parts have
    wasted but changed into more valuable. Ariel pretends that he is listening the ding dong sound
    of the bell.
    <br><br>
    In this poem death is shown as a meaningful change. Death is not an absolute end but only a
    process of transformation into another natural object. The main idea of this song is that - man
    who is part of nature transforms into another natural objects after death. The body of
    Ferdinand's father has been changed into something more valuable and strange. His bones have
    changed into corals and eyes into pearls. Even after death, he is warmly welcomed in heaven by
    nymphs by ringing the bell.

    2. Write a brief account on 'Art and Life' or 'Life and Art'.<br><br>
    Ans: The skill of creation is called Art. People in possession (having) of this creative skill
    are known as artist. Art may be different by its form, style and time. Although it is different
    by its form and style, art always influences human beings. Art always remains as an effective
    and important motivational factor for human beings. In order to live a happy and satisfied life,
    art is an inevitable aspect of life. An art in its supreme form is able to provide us the
    deepest inner freshness which in turn inspires us to make ourselves happy and amiable. To get
    rid of difficulties of life, it is immensely important for us to appreciate. By appreciating
    art, we can keep ourselves happy by forgetting the problems of life.
    <br><br>
    Human life is very transient (short) and when we die our life is finished. But despite this
    appearance of physical existence, an artist can live an immortal life. Life is sure to come to
    an end but art remains forever. Laxmi Prasad Devkota is remaining immortal among Nepali people
    for his fine piece of art in, literature in the form ofMuna Madan. Other great artist's of
    different artistic fields are still immortal because of their great works of art. When we enjoy
    art we find amiability within ourselves thereby inspiring us to appreciate art. It is indeed
    true that all works of art provide us the deepest experience and higher value of our life.
