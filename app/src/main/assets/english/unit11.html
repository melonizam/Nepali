<h3 align="center"><u>I HAVE A DREAM - Martin Luther King, Jr.</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    Martin Luther King, a black civil right campaigner, delivered an unforgettable speech " I Have a
    Dream" on August 28, 1963 commemorating the centennial of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
    In this speech he presses for equal treatment and improved circumstances for blacks, and
    stresses on the necessity of eradicating institutional racial inequalities. King expresses sharp
    dissatisfaction over segregation and racial discrimination. He demands a fast end to racial
    discrimination, pledging his followers to a fight to the finish to wipe out all forms of
    segregation and to achieve equality and integration. However, he is in favour of creative and
    disciplined protest without physical violence. In his speech he even appeals the Whites to join
    hands with Blacks in order to revolt against discriminatory practices against Blacks. He does
    not show hatred against Whites, he is against color discrimination and racial prejudice.<br><br>

    He is a dreamer with the vision of equality and justice. He wants a new America in its social
    makeup, establish symphony of brotherhood among blacks and whites, and eradicate the
    discriminatory treatment of black Americans. His dream is deeply rooted in the American dream of
    'life, liberty and pursuit of happiness'.<br><br>

    He voices that even after hundred years of passing of Emancipation Proclamation by Lincoln,
    America stands as the hell to the blacks. Blacks are exiled in their own country and live in
    poverty in the vast ocean of material prosperity.<br><br>

    He also mentions the words of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence which guaranteed
    the unalienable rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. But these magnificent words
    were not applied into practice in case of colored citizens. He demands the riches of freedom,
    security of justice, and citizenship rights to the blacks. He argues that the policy of
    gradualism in the matter of justice will raise discontent among blacks.<br></p>

<h4>Important Questions :</h4>

<p class="b">

    1. What is the apparent (exact) purpose of the speech of Martin Luther King Jr.? Explain King's
    analogy of bad check (cheque).<br><br>
    Ans. The apparent purpose of King's speech is to get the black people their rights of freedom,
    equality and justice avoiding racial injustice based on color of skin. Although the constitution
    of America promises equal rights to its entire citizen, the black people have been deprived from
    enjoying the rights and get the victim of social segregation and discrimination. Therefore
    Martin Luther King Jr. Delivers this speech demanding justice for the black people. King makes
    an analogy (comparison) between promises of an American constitution and a bad check. Though the
    constitution of America promises equal right rights to the entire citizen irrespective of colour
    and creed, America has failed to pay her black citizen the rights promised in the constitution.
    They are given bad check i.e. false promises by architects of American constitution. If there is
    insufficient amount in the bank out, the cheque of higher amount issued against this account is
    not enchased and returned unpaid such cheque is consider as a bad check. Similar way although
    the constitution of America guarantees the equality for all, the black citizens are turned down
    from getting justice in America. Therefore, king compares the promises made by the American
    constitution with a bad check.<br>
