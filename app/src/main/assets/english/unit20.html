<h3 align="center"><u>THE LITTLE BROTHER AND THE LITTLE SISTER - Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    'The Little Brother and the Little Sister' an English translation of 'Hansel and Gretel' by
    Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, deals with the same story of Hansel and Gretel. The writer sincerely
    included all the essential points of the original story to make it complete and harmonious.
    However, one finds the dialogues between the character and other being eliminated. The minute
    details of the original story are simply summarized and the conversation between one character
    and the other is narrated. The stepmother is described as a 'woman' and shown to have wicked
    nature in the original is modified to some extent and described as the mother. Her vocatives
    "you lazybones", "wicked children", "You fool" etc. meant for Hansel and Gretel are eliminated.
    Such expressions make her appear no better than a witch. Removal of these expressions helps in
    modifying her into a less witch and more unloving mother. In addition to it, the physical
    attributes of the witch are ignored in this adaption. <br><br>
    In the original, one finds remarkable
    similarity between the stepmother and the witch in their way of talking with and beating the
    children. In the adoption, one finds the difference. Moreover, the last part of the original
    story includes the rich details such as ecstasy of the children over the death of the witch,
    return journey, crossing the stream with the help of the duck, father's joy over the reunion
    etc. Such details and jubilant feelings are not included in the adoption.</p>
