<h3 align="center"><u>THE BOARDING HOUSE - Wilhelm Grimn</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    After a difficult marriage with a drunken husband that ends in separation, Mrs. Mooney opens a
    boarding house to make a living. Jack, her son and Polly, her daughter live with her in the
    house, which is occupied by clerks from the city, as well as occasional tourists and musicians.
    Mrs. Mooney runs a strict and tight business and is known by the lodgers as "The Madam." Polly,
    who used to work in an office, now stays at home at her mother's request, to amuse the lodgers
    and help with the cleaning. Surrounded by so many young men, Polly ultimately develops a
    relationship with a rich thirty five years old Mr. Doran.<br><br>

    Mrs. Mooney knows about the relationship, but instead of sending Polly back to work in the city,
    she monitors its developments. Polly becomes increasingly uncomfortable with her mother's lack
    of intervention, but Mrs. Mooney waits until "the right moment" to intercede. First she speaks
    awkwardly with Polly, then arranges to speak with Mr. Doran on a Sunday morning. Mrs. Mooney
    looks forward to her argument which she intends to "win" by defending her daughter's honor and
    convincing Mr. Doran to offer his hand in marriage. Waiting for the time to pass, Mrs. Mooney
    figures the odds are in her favor, considering that Mr. Doran, who has worked for a wine
    merchant for thirteen years and gained much respect, will choose the option that least harms his
    career.<br><br>

    Meanwhile, Mr. Doran is in distress. He knows he will be called by Mrs. Mooney. He reviews the
    difficult confession to his priest that he made on Saturday evening, in which he was harshly
    accused for his romantic affair. He knows he can either marry Polly or run away, the latter an
    option that would ruin his sound reputation. Convincing himself that he has been tricked, Mr.
    Doran bemoans Polly's unimpressive family, her ill manners, and her poor grammar, and wonders
    how he can remain free and unmarried. In this vexed moment Polly enters the room and threatens
    to end her life out of unhappiness. In her presence, Mr. Doran begins to remember how he was
    trapped by Polly's beauty and kindness, but he still hesitates about his decision.<br><br>

    Uneasy, Mr. Doran comforts Polly and departs for the meeting, leaving her to wait in the room.
    She rests on the bed crying for a while, neatens her appearance, and then nestles back in the
    bed, dreaming of her possible future with Mr. Doran. Finally, Mrs. Mooney interrupts the
    daydream by calling to her daughter. Mr. Doran, according to Mrs. Mooney, wants to speak with
    Polly.</p><br>

<h4>Important Questions :</h4>

<p class="b">
    1. Sketch the character of Mrs. Mooney.<br><br>
    Ans : Mrs. Mooney, the main character in the James Joyce story "The Boarding House" is described
    as "a woman who deals with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat". She was a butcher's
    daughter who married her father's foreman. Later she divorced him because she could not
    withstand his drinking and bullying nature. Taking charge of her daughter Polly and son Jack,
    she opened a boarding house in Hardwicke Street. She was strong, strict, determined and
    practical. She knew how to handle matters- when to act and when to remain silent.<br><br>

    When reading further in the story, we find that the boarding house is a trap, where Mrs. Mooney
    is a hunter who's looking for a decent husband for her daughter Polly within her guests. She is
    using Polly as bait to catch Mr. Doran, the victim in the story. Mrs. Mooney manipulates Mr.
    Doran into her trap by using her daughter's innocence as the bait and Mr. Doran's innocence as a
    victim. Mrs. Mooney is a woman of business and Mr. Doran is the perfect victim for her and for
    Polly. Mr. Doran has also a decent job and he fits perfectly to the economical needs of Mrs.
    Mooney. Mrs. Mooney also uses their society and religion as a tool to cause Mr. Doran marrying
    her daughter. She knows that her victim is a religious man, who lives in the religious culture
    of Dublin that obeys to the rules of the church. He is afraid of the church and he is afraid to
    lose his job in the Catholic wine merchant office. Thus Mr. Doran had no other option than
    marrying Polly. Mrs. Mooney is like a watchdog that watches that the prey will not run out of
    the trap, but will run into it.</p><br>
