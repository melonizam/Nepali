<h3 align="center"><u>HURRIED TRIP TO AVOID A BAD STAR - M. Lilla and C. Bishop Berry</u></h3>

<p class="a">
    American geographers M. Lilla and C. Bishop Barry in their essay Hurried trip to avoid a Bad
    Star present an exploration of Karnali zone of western Nepal on foot for 15 months. This essay
    was published as a visit report in The National Geographic as Karnali, The road less World of
    Western Nepal in 1971. The writers in this essay describe the life account of Karnali zone
    people, their daily life, their tradition and culture, their lack of awareness about
    environmental preservation and Karnali zone's economic dependency with the plain region of south
    Nepal.<br><br>

    With a view to study above mentioned aspects, the writers move to plain of south Nepal with the
    peasants (farmers) who were going towards Nepalgunj for their daily provisions. They were
    carrying medicinal herbs, hand knitted sweaters and blankets etc. to sell in Nepalgunj while
    climbing step hill near Hari Lekh a Chhetri women of about 30 requested them to send her husband
    back home who left the house 15 years ago in search of job in the Terai. For this request
    revealed the concept of Karnali zone people about parameter of the world. In a Sal forest slope
    the writers noticed the chopping down trees from several direction which indicated the
    possibility of rapid deforestation in the region. On enquiry, the people explained their
    compulsion to chop down the trees to feed their animals which exposed their lack of education
    and ignorance about the importance of preservation of environment. The writers noticed a group
    of 8 or 9 men in a forest processingSilajit in order to sell in Nepalgunj. This superstitious
    people made a hurried trip from their home valley to avoid evil influence of bad star. On
    arrival in Nepalgunj the writers watched the hill people buying their daily provisions; one of
    them spent all his money buying distillery equipments with a hope to earn money by selling
    alcohol. The writers concluded their journey at Jumla. They expressed their concern on lack of
    awareness on Karnali zone people about protection of nature and about the need of educating
    people regarding this vital aspect. They expressed that Karnali zone people were living in very
    difficult place with a very low agricultural production. The writers suggested them to involve
    themselves in trade with the Terai region in order to make their life easy with satisfactory
    earning.

<h4>Important Question :</h4>

<p class="b">
    1. How is Karnali linked economically with the low land regions to the south?<br><br>
    Ans. Geographically, Karnali lies to the northern part of our kingdom. As it is made up of very
    sloppy hills, there are many problems. People do not have transportation and other facilities
    for their better survival. There is no sufficient cultivable land. So, they have to depend on
    the lowland regions to the south. People of karnali cannot sell their products in their
    localities. To sell their items like medicinal herbs, silajit, hashish, hand-knit sweaters and
    blankets, they have to go to Nepalgunj. Similarly, they cannot buy goods in their places. For
    this purpose also, they have to depend upon lowland regions. People of Karnali have to depend
    upon lowland region for their jobs also. Being undeveloped part, it does not have factories. To
    earn livelihood, young people have no better options than leaving their places and working in
    the lowland region.<br><br>

    2. What did the two writers learn about the life and culture of the people of the Karnali region
    during their journey on foot?<br><br>
    Ans. "Hurried Trip to Avoid a Bad Star" is written by American geographers M. Lilla and C.
    Bishop Barry. Their essay presents social, economic and educational aspects of Karnali region.
    To present these aspects, they have brought four events in the text- their meeting with a
    chhetri woman and the people processing silajit, and their encounter cutting down trees and the
    people of Karnali buying and selling things. The two writers learnt that the people of Karnali
    are innocent, simple, laborious and uneducated. Their world is narrow and limited. The Chhetri
    woman asks the travelers to find her husband and send him to the village. They live in
    geographically difficult part completely depending on their own or animal strength. They are
    ignorant about soil erosion and deforestation. Not only that, alcohol consumption in Karnali
    region is high because one of the porters buys distillery equipments in the bazaar of Nepalgunj.
    He hopes that he would sell liqueur and earn enough money to buy goods in Karnali.</p><br>
