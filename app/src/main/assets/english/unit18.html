<h3 align="center"><u>THE GINGERBREAD HOUSE - Robert Coover</u></h3>

<p class="a">

    The same fairy tale 'Hansel and Gretel' is adopted by Robert Coover with the title 'The
    Gingerbread House'. He used the device of exaggeration to parody the form of the original. In
    order to do so, he eliminated the first part of the story that is exposition of the crisis and
    the last part such as complication and denouement.<br><br>
    In other words, the important events and the sequence between one and the other event are not
    included in the story. In place of the events,
    he furnished the story with such as the physical attributes of the characters and the forest.
    Every detail was exaggerated to such an extent that the action and the movement of the story
    become slow and sluggish. Besides the addition, he modified the characters, Hansel and Gretel by
    describing their frequent quarrels and reconciliation. Even the old father who was kind in the
    original story appears irritant now and then. At one occasion he strikes the boy without any
    reason. Similarly the witch is presented as outrageous lunatic shredding her own clothes,
    clawing cruelly at her face and throat, crackling, screeching and tearing doves. Because of such
    modification, addition and elimination of different aspects of the story, one finds the events
    beating about the bush.</p>
