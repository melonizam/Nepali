<h4>1. <u>Strategies for Listening Test:</u>
</h4>

<h4>2. <u>Before Listening:</u></h4>

<h4><u>Read and follow the instructions:</u></h4>
<ol class="b">
    <li> Read the questions carefully in detail.						 </li>
    <li> Check the number of words allowed in each answer.               </li>
    <li> Figure out whether the answer is a word or a letter or a number.</li>
    <li> Watch out for the Spelling errors.                              </li>
    <li> Use capital letter at the beginning of a proper noun.           </li>
</ol>


<h4>2. <u>Predict what will you hear:</u></h4>


<ol class="b">
    <li>Look carefully at the vocabulary used in the question.</li>
    <li>Think of other words with similar meanings, and words with opposite meanings</li>
    <li>If the same words are used on the tape as in the question, this is usually as a distracter, sometimes with a negative </li>
    <li>The answer to one question will never be given in another question.</li>
    <li>Identify what kind of information you need to listen for to get the answer-both the information that will be close to the answer, and what type of information you need for the answer itself.</li>
</ol>

<h4><u>While Listening</u></h4>

<p class="a">
    You are allowed to write while you listen. </br></br>
    Do not try to understand every single word; this is not necessary and does not happen in everyday life. Important words for meaning are always stressed more than other words in a sentence, so you only need to hear and understand the stressed words. </br></br>
    Answers are usually given in the same sequence as the questions. </br></br>
    Multiple Choice-elimination of wrong answers is easier than finding one correct answer. Usually you can eliminate two answers quickly. </br></br>
    Even if you think you have an answer to a particular question, do not stop listening to the part of the tape that relates to the question. Often the answers seems to have been given, but is corrected later. </br></br>
    Do not use your own general knowledge to answer the questions. All answers should be taken from the text. It does not matter if you disagree with the information given- base all your answers on what you hear. </br></br>
    Don't panic if you don't recognise some words. Some are not relevant for questions. Some are relevant but you can work out their meaning from the context. </br>

</p>

<h4><u>After Listening</u></h4>

<p class="a">
    You are given a short(about 30 seconds) to check your answers after each section. Do not use this time to transfer your questions to the answer sheet. Make any additional notes of points that you think may be important, then move on to reading the instructions for the next task. </br></br>

    After all sections of listening, you are given ten minutes to transfer your answers. Don't just transfer your answers mechanically- first check through all the questions, referring to the notes you have made(usually the key words you heard), and make a final decision on what each answer is. Even for the answers you are sure of, check spelling and use of capital letters. Do not leave any answers blank. If in doubt, guess. Remember there is no negative marking. </br></br>
