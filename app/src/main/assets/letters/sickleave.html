<p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing this letter to notify to you that I am unable to attend school for next 3 days, that is, from 17 April to 17 April, as I am suffering from severe cold and food poisoning. I have been recommended by the doctor to take plenty of bed rest for faster recovery.<br><br>
