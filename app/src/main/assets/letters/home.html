<p align="left">Dear Papa and Mama,</p>

<p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came here exactly at 4 o'clock in the afternoon after taking a bus from Gorkhabazar at one o'clock. Now, I am living at Tandibazar. It is a small town I have taken a room in rent. It is behind my school. It is as big as our living room. It faces the east. So, it is very sunny. There are two big windows in my room. I have to walk just five minutes to reach the school from my room.
<br><br>

The toilet and bathroom are separate. But, there is the problem of water. The water comes early in the morning and late in the evening. If the water is not filled in those times, the clothes cannot be washed and pots cannot be cleaned. The landlord and landlady are very friendly. Here isn't any telephone facility. But, my landlord has filled application for telephone. I hope the telephone will be installed very soon.<br><br>

The rules and regulations of the house are very strict. Everybody should clean the toilet and the bathroom everyday and the house once a week. The dirts should be thrown into a pit. No one is allowed to come inside and go outside the house after nine o'clock in the evening and to drink beer inside it.<br><br>

I have to walk on foot for 5 minutes to reach my school. The bus station is on 5 minutes walk. I hope you are quite fine. Convey my regards to my uncle, aunt and other neighbors. This much for today.
