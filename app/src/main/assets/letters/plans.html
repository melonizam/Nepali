<h3 align="center"><u>LETTER TO A FRIEND TELLING YOUR PLAN FOR NEXT 12 MONTH</u></h3>

<p align="right">Imadol, Kathmandu<br>
17 April, 2015</p>

<p align="left">Dear Sunita,</p>

<p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got your letter on 16 April. I became very happy as I got it after a long time. Here, I am quite fine. I hope you are also fine there. As you had asked me to write my plans for the next twelve months, I am going to write about them in short.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will study very hard to pass the examination, which is coming very near. After that, there will be summer vacation in our school. I think I will go to visit many beautiful cities of my country. Then, I will join class 12. At Dashain and Tihar festival, I will go to my own house. I will enjoy the festivals by playing swing and cards. After this, our school will reopen. In the winter vacation, I will go to Kathmandu to check my eye. Sometimes, tear comes from my eyes while studying textbooks. After the winter vacation, when our school opens again, there will be many extra curricular activities. I think I will take part in essay writing and volleyball tournament. If I passed the examination, I would go to Kathmandu for further study.<br><br>

This  much for today. I will write more for the next time.<br><br></p>

<p align="right"> Yours faithfully<br>Alisha shrestha</p>
