I'm healthy Nepalese citizen of 23 years old. I passed SLC from Little Angels School, Lalitpur in 2004. Then, I completed +2 in Management from Global Management College, Baneswor & BBS from in 2007 & 2011 respectively. Now, I've been doing MBS in KUSOM. As my training, I've taken trained related to accountancy. Now, I've been working as chief accountant in Yala Multipurpose Cooperative for last 3 years. My experience might be found useful for your bank.<br><br>
